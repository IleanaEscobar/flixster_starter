### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I thiink that the labs did help me prepeare to complete the assignment given that I had never worked with or learned any javascript,http,or css before. The first lab was the first time I ever used http or css and it taught me how to properly add the elements I wanted and try styling them in the correct way. Specifially I was introduced to using display: flex; which I ended up using in this project. The second lab was extremely useful since it taught me how to use javascript and be able to modify html code. I ended up directly using some of the same techniques, like using innerHTML to update the movie grid. The thid lab was useful because although I habe experience working with API's, I had no idea how to call them with javascript so that formatting I learned entirely from lab 3.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I think I would implement more feature like a search by genre, or a drop down with options to search by, like language, geographic origin, etc. I would also want to add a way for users to give reviews of the movies with comments and post them underneath the movie description.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

### Shout out

I would like to give a shout out to my instructor Phineas who helped me figure out how to use the inspect selector to debug my code and also to my fellow intern Kareem Dacost who was having the same issues I was embeding the videos in the popup and helped me work through it together.
